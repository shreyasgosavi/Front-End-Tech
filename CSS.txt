CSS

Different Methods to style the page.
	1. External CSS		3. Inline-CSS
	2. Internal CSS


Different ways to catch the elements :
	1. Element Selector	3. Id Selector
	2. Class Selector


Terms	:  Specificity, Inheritance 
	
Note 	:
	The cross mark while inspecting the element is basically the design that are over-
ridden by some other design due to specificity or cascading reason.

Units and Sizes :

	Determines the size of the objects in the page. 
	
	Categories of Sizes :
		1. Absolute Size	2. Relative Size
		
		1. Absolute Size : The size of the text remains the same even thought we
			try to change the browser settings or changing the window size.
			Eg : px

		2. Relative Size : The size of the object is relative to its parent node.
			Eg : 
				%	<--	Percent related to the parent element.	
				rem	<-- 	Size-Relative to the root element.
						(Generally used for font-size)

				em	<--	Size-Relative to the parent element.
						(Used for specifying margin-padding prop.) 

				ch	<--	Width based-on the character size.
	
	For absolute size the most widely used unit is px, default size in the browser is 
	16px.


CSS Box-Model :

	Everything in css are boxes, arrangement of those elements is very useful.
	CSS Box-model has several components namely : content, padding, border and margin.
	
	By-default browser assigns some value to the components which might result in 
	inconsistency in future (using rem can lead to unexpected results), hence it is
	necessary to reset the CSS components value and take control of them.

	Like this :
		*{
			margin:0;
			padding:0;
			box-sizing: border-box;
		}
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Note : 	box-sizing specifies how the over-all size of the program will be calculated.
		Default value is content-box which means what-ever value of the component
		we specify it just applies it to the content only the value of padding,
		margin is not taken into account.	
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Outline tag is used to cover the end of the boundries.


Typography :

	It is the way in which the text is arranged and presented. 
	We can change the properties of the text like the font, spacing between the words,
	letters, etc. 	
	
	Several css properties are there that make such changes possible eg :

		font-size, font-family, text-align, text-decoration, letter-spacing, etc.
		

		
Styling Links :
	
	Links are contained in the anchor tag in which the href attribute links to the page
	where we wanted	to visit. Like other properties, some properties of links are set by 
	the browser by default.
	
	Eg:	text-decoration is underline, color is blue, cursor is pointer.

	Links have multiple states and state-related attributes that help identify them.
	States of the links are : visited, hover, un-visited.

	Those properties can be specified with the help of the pseudo-classes specified by
	":" after the attribute-name.
	
	Eg: 	a:hover{

			color:dodgerblue;	
		}

		


	Note : The order of writing the preprocessors is also important, proper ordering of
	several events :

	a{} ; a:visited; a:Hover


Display :
	
	There are two types of elements inline and block level elements. Inline elements are
the one that take only required space of an object.
